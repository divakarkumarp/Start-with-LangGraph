It allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence that are most relevant to the task at hand. Think of it like a spotlight that highlights important words.\\n\\n* **Encoder-Decoder Structure:**  Transformers usually consist of an encoder and a decoder.\\n    * **Encoder:**  Processes the input sequence, understanding its meaning.\\n    * **Decoder:**  Generates the output sequence based on the encoder's understanding.\\n\\n* **Positional Encodings:**  Since Transformers don't process data sequentially like RNNs, they need a way to know the order of words.  Positional encodings are added to the input embeddings to provide this information.\\n\\n**Impact:**\\n\\nTransformers have revolutionized NLP, leading to significant improvements in:\\n\\n* **Machine Translation:**  Producing more accurate and fluent translations.\\n* **Text Summarization:**  Generating concise and informative summaries of large texts.\\n* **Question Answering:**  Providing accurate answers to questions based on given context.\\n* **Text Generation:**  Creating human-like text for various applications, such as chatbots and story writing.\\n\\n**Popular Transformer Models:**\\n\\n* BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)\\n* GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)\\n* T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)\\n* LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications)\\n\\n**In essence, Transformers are powerful tools that have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing.**\\n\", response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 456, 'prompt_tokens': 12, 'total_tokens': 468, 'completion_time': 0.829090909, 'prompt_time': 7.704e-05, 'queue_time': 0.01280653, 'total_time': 0.829167949}, 'model_name': 'Gemma2-9b-It', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_10c08bf97d', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-58169626-2da1-49ee-b8a8-6236e3c77802-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 456, 'total_tokens': 468})}])\n",
